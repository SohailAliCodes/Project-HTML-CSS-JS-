		Established in 2008, the Smile Child Org. is one of the oldest child abuse prevention organisation in Kolkata. We are a non-government, non-religious charitable organisation that works with vulnerable children and people across Australia to prevent child maltreatment in all its forms, including emotional, physical and sexual abuse. We provide evidence-based educational programs that build well-being, emotional resiliency and create the strong family environments needed to ensure that children are safe, supported, and loved. Our staff are experienced educational psychologists that are well-equipped to deliver programs designed to increase protective behaviours in children and forever break the cycle of abuse.

	<p> 	One of the key recommendations of the Royal Commission into Institutional Responses to Child Sexual Abuse concerned the need for prevention education to raise childrenâ€™s awareness of abuse and develop their resiliency against maltreatment.
	<br><br>
	Our Safe Children, Safe Families (SCSF) program has been designed to prevent all forms of child abuse. It does this by providing 3 to 5 year-old children with the necessary knowledge, skills and capabilities to avoid potentially abusive or unsafe situations and to get help sooner if they do experience maltreatment.

			<p> Our journey so far</p>
		</center>
	</div>
	<p>
		Since 2016 CAPS has successfully delivered the SCSF program in childcare centres with impressive results. Data collected from a sample of over 475 children that participated in SCSF demonstrated that they became better at identifying feelings, early warning signs and unsafe situations. Their retention of key personal safety messages improved and they were able to develop important personal safety networks for accessing help and support.
	<br><br>
	As a not for profit organisation, we need your help to continue to deliver SCSF and our other abuse prevention programs to children, parents and carers.
